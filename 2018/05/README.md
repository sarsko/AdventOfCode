## Day 5

### Part 1

I spent way too long realizing that I needed the `isLower` check in `solver`.
Other than that, quite happy.

### Part 2

Went way quicker than part 1. I am quite happy with this one. Could probably be
made nicer if I knew my combinators, but other than that, pretty happy overall.

Solution takes forever though, but I'm not sure if that is me or Haskell.
