## Day 1

### 1-1

Could probably have made this a complete script, but can't be bothered.(and no point tbh)

Just run

```
grep -o \) input1.txt | wc -l
```

and

```
grep -o \( input1.txt | wc -l
```

and subtract the first number with the second.

### 1-2

Made a quick and dirty Kotlin solution.

Run:
```
kotlinc day1_2.kt && cat input1.txt | Kotlin Day1_2Kt
```
