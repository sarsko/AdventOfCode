## Day 4

Really quite happy with this one. Figured out what I needed, found it and
implemented it. Like sure `convert` and `noDuplicates` are slight modifications
of code I found on SO, and ideally I would write them myself, but I think being
able to identify what one needs and find it and implement it is a good step.
Also really like that there is only one `solve` method, that would probably not
have been the case if I did it imperatively.

To run:

```
runhaskell 04.hs
```

First is part 1, second is part 2
