## Day 2

### Part 1

Not too much to say, pretty straight forward. Checked solutions after and found
the one with list comprehension which led me down a rabbithole, which eventually
helped me for part 2.

### Part 2

Found all the pieces, but had to "cheat" to find the nice way of putting it
together.

To run:

```
runhaskell 02.hs
```

First is part 1, second is part 2
