## Day 1

### Part 1

Wey, my first Haskell solution. Very happy.
Is it perfect? No. Is it good enough? Yes.

Very cool

### Part 2

A bit uglier with the `let`-bindings and all, just couldn't bother with figuring
out which combination of dollars and parantheses to use. Perhaps I could have
used beefy dollar(`<$>`).

To run:

```
runhaskell 01.hs
```

First is part 1, second is part 2
