## Day 7

A hacky Python solution. I like. Part 1 is the first line printed, and part 2
has to be done partly manually. The final line is the offending node and its
total weight. One then has to look at the difference between that branch and the
non-offending branches, and subtract the difference from the nodes self weight. Could make
it fully automatic, but can't be bothered.
