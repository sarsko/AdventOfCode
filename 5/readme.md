## Day 5

When I saw the task, I immediately thought:

"This is a task for APL!"

Now, the problem is, I don't know APL, so I have spent far more time than I would like to admit
on solving todays task, but I must say: it was a lot of fun:)

I have no idea if my solution is even vaguely idiomatic, but it solves the problem,
and is quite succinct, so I am happy.

If you would like to run it, or try out APL yourself(which I recommend), then I used
[dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/)
and added
```
alias dyalog="/Applications/Dyalog-18.0.app/Contents/Resources/Dyalog/dyalog"
```
to my rc-file(this is probably not the correct way to do it, but it works), and
then I ran my file with
```
dyalog -script day05.dyalog
```
I did development in the Dyalog REPL thingy.

Also, I would really recommend [aplcart](https://aplcart.info/), it is the best resource
I have found.
