## Day 15

Probably the one I liked the least this far.

Just implement the rules and press run. If there are any major insights, then I haven't had them.
This time I made my solution generic so there's that. Also had to swap out my arrays for vectors for part 2(stack overflow with arrays).

To run:
```
cargo aoc -d 15
```
