## Day 16

Using Rust to do AoC is really quite fun - I end up going down different rabbit holes each time.

### The solution

Part1 is really simple, and part2 is really ugly. Nice.

Couldn't be bothered parsing things so a lot of the stuff is hard coded in. The solution solves the problem(for me) and not much else.

to run:
```
cargo aoc -d 16
```
