## Day 17

Really happy with todays performance. Bummed out I didn't do it as soon as it
came out, as I honestly think I could have made top 100. Pretty much everything
went well. I think it is ad-hoc stuff like this where Python really shines. You
can read the problem description while translating it to code, and then add some
`for`-loops and some `if`-checks, and then you're done. One of the more original
simulation tasks I have seen, as well. Cool.
