## Day 9

Messed up way more than I like to admit on this one. I initially solved the
bounds checking by padding, which made part 2 quite hairy. I also didn't read
that diagonals shouldn't be included. Oh well. Got something quite decent and
correct after
a bit, and then I kept reducing it to the mess of lambdas and one-liners it now
is. I think the solution is structurally quite good, but I'm not sure exchanging
all the functions and for-loops with lambdas and comprehensions made it any more
readable. Oh well.
