## Day 8

Today was an exercise in reading comprehension. I spent way too long on just
parsing what task 1 asked for. When doing part 2, I initally did tried to deduce
which segment mapped to which segment, only to realise that that wasn't needed
at all. Once everything was groked, actually implementing the solution was quite
fast and straightforward. Didn't go for any fancy stuff, just a bunch of `if`s
and some `for`-loops. In retrospect I should have implemented a quick and dirty
brute-force method, though I'm not sure if it would be all that much faster to
implement. Oh well. Pretty cool day overall.
