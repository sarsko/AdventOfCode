## Day 7

Was curious about how hard it is to reach top 100, so thought I might as well
try. Ended up doing it quick and dirty in Python, and got 480 on part 1 and 325
on part 2.

Room for improvement:
- Loading the page
- Getting the input
- Having the reading function ready to go
- Understanding what the task asks for quicker
- Simply having stuff like `99999999999` as `H` or `HIGH`
- Being even more vigilant in variable naming and having shit code
- 2 monitors

In addition to just being faster/better.
