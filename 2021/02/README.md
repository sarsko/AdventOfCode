## Day 2

I was planning on doing this in the evening after arriving in Bangkok, but since
my ferry got delayed by almost 4 hours, and I missed my flight, I decided to do
it on the bus. As my laptop is broken as well, I had to do it on the phone.

So, todays problem was done in Python on my phone by remote logging to the university
computers in Oslo using Termius, while on a bus in Thailand. Pretty cool. Also,
the latency from here to Norway and back through 4G is abysmal.
