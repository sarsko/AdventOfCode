## Day 3

Excel solution to part 1 here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nDh2FhM0vOlEV3WBhL4p1YIXRQ1MHlGRr-qzuUTtbqk/edit?usp=sharing

Did part 1 initially in Excel. Pretty straight forward, turns out Excel isn't
too bad at splitting up into columns, adding those, and figuring if the values
are greater than/less than some value. Probably possible to do part 2 in Excel
as way, but I had no idea how, so I gave up and did the whole thing in Haskell.

Overall quite happy. Not perfect, but I think it is fairly readable, and no huge
blemishes. Good practice. I think today would do well in APL. Maybe I'd done it
in APL if I weren't busy travelling.
