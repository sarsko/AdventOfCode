## Day 1

### Python

Did it quick and dirty with Python so that I could spend as much time as I
wanted in Haskell(not that it mattered as I started late). I really like the
god-awful `try-except`-block in part 2.

### Haskell

#### Part 1

It isn't too bad, but it isn't great either. I don't like the overcounting and
`(-1 +)` in the end.

#### Part 2

There does probably exist nicer solutions, but I am overall not too dissatisfied
with this one. Would have liked it to be able to work with any size window, I
guess I have to learn how to do that. I like the reuse of `solveA`.
