## Day 4

### 4-1

Pretty happy with this one - quite succinct. Opted to try out File and read() this time.

```
kotlinc day04.kt && Kotlin Day04Kt
```

### 4-2

The same solution just larger. This is the kind of code that becomes unmanageble over time lol.
It's defo better to break up the regex.

```
kotlinc day04_2.kt && Kotlin Day04_2Kt
```
