## Day 12

I'm not catching up with this speed, that's for certain. Christmas dinner today, so haven't had time to do much AoC.

### The solution

I'm quite happy with today's solution. It's not anything special, just a pretty clean and straight forward imperative solution.
I guess the handling of F, L and R requires some insight, and I believe my solution is quite decent.

To run:
```
cargo aoc -d 12
```
