## Day 06

No APL today:(

Of course, it could be solved in APL, but I don't think problems that obviously should
involve sets lends themselves well to APL(but what do I know, I wrote my first line
of APL yesterday)

Not too much to say today. Decent solution on part 1, part 2 is unsexy,
but it works, and I can't be bothered to sexify it. Some fold or reduce shit with
the right stuff could make it into a cute little short non-destructive piece of code.
